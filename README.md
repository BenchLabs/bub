## Warning / Disclaimer

Everything here is experimental and the commands are subject to, and will,
change. Also, when listing the manifests the list is also incomplete, until each
project is properly updated.


## Installation

### From source

Install prereqs below.

    $ make install

## Setup

To setup bub, you need to have AWS credentials. Run:

    $ bub setup

First you'll be pompted to enter your AWS credentials in the
`~/.aws/credentials`. Then bub will create the `~/.config/bub/config.yml`. You
don't have to edit it unless you want to add some credentials to get more
features. Adding your Jenkins credentials makes bub super userful.

## Usage

To be expanded, when in doubt, `-h` with any command/sub-command should give you
an idea of what you can do.

    # from any directory
    $ bub # or with --help
    $ bub eb
    $ bub ec2

    # in a repo
    $ bub gh repo
    $ bub gh issues
    # ...

## Prerequisites

    # macOS to use the open commands (you can symlink xdg-open to open on Linux)
    $ brew install golang # tested with 1.8.1 must fix version in future.
    $ brew install graphviz

## Build

    $ make deps
    $ make
    $ bin/bub<your-platform>
